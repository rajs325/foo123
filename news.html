On Sunday, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, warned the outbreak remained at a âdelicate and dangerousâ stage and said it was irresponsible to speculate about steps to modify the rules underpinning governmentâs âstay home, protect the NHS, save livesâ strategy.</p><p>More than 20,000 people have died from Covid-19 in NHS hospitals and thousands more in care homes. But there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. Gerard Lyons, Johnsonâs economics adviser when he was London mayor, warned on Sunday the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also called on ministers to start talking to teachers, businesses, trade unions and town hall leaders and open âhonest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look likeâ. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion, but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/the-key-areas-to-look-at-in-easing-the-uk-coronavirus-lockdown">Continue reading...</a></p>

<p class="card-text"><p>A rapid rise in MLB home runs has led to conspiracy theories, but scoring in sport is on the rise â except in football</p><p>Something strange happened in Major League Baseball last year. Batters on the 30 teams started hitting home runs at an unprecedented rate from opening day in late March and kept it up all the way to the World Series in October. May brought a record for homers in a calendar month. It was broken in June. By the end of the season, MLBâs increasingly traumatised battalions of pitchers had collectively given up 6,776 homers, an advance of nearly 11% on the previous record of 6,106. While professional baseball has more teams now than it did in its early days, the per-game rate of 1.37 was a big step up on the previous record, too.</p><p>Theories abound as to the reason for the homer boom, including some that sound so loopy that you desperately want them to be true and others that are downright conspiratorial. A personal favourite is that it might be down to mozzies. It was, so the thinking goes, a bumper year for biting insects in the pastures where the cows that provide the leather for around 160,000 MLB baseballs each year like to graze. Millions of tiny proboscises left millions of tiny holes in the hides, which then acted a bit like the dimples on a golf ball when subjected to a whack from a Louisville Slugger.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/may/25/why-there-is-no-accounting-for-luck-in-the-premier-league">Why there is no accounting for a large slice of luck in the Premier League | Greg Wood</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/01/major-league-baseball-football-expectations-penalties-mosquitos">Continue reading...</a></p>

And though most people will steadily improve and recover, a small percentage (up 4%) suffer a precipitous, unpredicted and sometimes delayed decline. Experts are warning that waiting for the âclassicâ symptoms â difficulty in breathing and high fever â may mean that some cases of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-testing-pneumonia.html">pneumonia </a>and other complications may be missed. But how do you know whether youâre the one who will need hospitalisation? Will you end up in ICU? How do you know when youâre out of the woods? And are there any specific ways of assessing whether youâre getting better or worse?</p><p>Most of us can put up with the sweats, aches, cough and deep fatigue for a few days if we know that weâll turn the corner and begin a couple of weeks of gradual recovery. Michael, a 27-year-old coronavirus patient, told me: âAt first, it was like wading through a sea of treacle just to reach the loo. I felt like a small child was sitting on my chest so that breathing was really hard work. Then after a couple of days, my breathing eased and I could potter around my flat like my grandmother does, though a bit slower. The thought of going out for a 5K run, which I used to do in about 24 minutes, still feels impossible. But Iâm in my third week and I can feel that Iâm on the mend. I wish that someone had told me that it would take this long because not knowing is really scary.â</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/oxygen-levels-coronavirus-symptoms-oximeters-gp">Continue reading...</a></p>

The year is 1668: Charles II is on the throne and Richard Cromwell, son of Oliver, is supposedly in exile. However, in the eight years since the Restoration the kingâs popularity has begun to wane and, amid growing unease about both his extravagance and the licentiousness of his court, nostalgia for the protectorate is taking hold. Lovett is more irritated than diverted when Richardâs daughter Elizabeth wants to renew their friendship. However, the meeting is far from coincidental, and soon both Lovett and Marwood are drawn into the cut and thrust of political intrigue and find themselves in great danger. With expert storytelling, memorable characters, emotional depth and some nice touches of humour, this is well up to Taylorâs usual high standard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/24/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a></p>

That may be changing â not before time</p><p>Almost seven weeks after the World Health Organization confirmed the pandemic, Europe remains in <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" title="">the frontline</a> of the battle to contain the Covid-19 virus. Five of the six countries reporting most cases are in Europe. Seven of the 10 countries reporting most deaths are in our continent too. Yet Europe has struggled to make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-our-nations-are-self-isolating-too" title="">common cause</a> against the virus. In particular, it has bickered over how to support the most affected European economies against the consequences of the lockdown. In spite of innumerable acts of cross-border solidarity on the medical front, the rich nations of Europe have proved reluctant backers of the continentâs embattled poorer economies.</p><p>The good news, relatively speaking, is that this divide has not got worse and may, just possibly, have eased a little. This week, leaders of the 27 EU nations finally signed off on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/clashes-predicted-over-trillion-euro-covid-19-aid-as-eu-meets-online" title="">â¬540bn rescue package</a>. This gives countries such as Italy and Spain, which stand second and third to the United States in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the right to borrow from the eurozoneâs bailout mechanism. The problem is that the EUâs southern member states are reluctant to borrow their way out of the problem, in part because they fear that to take on more debt would deepen the inequality between the EUâs south and north.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-and-covid-19-better-late-than-never">Continue reading...</a></p>

Departing from the usual cautious script in answer to a question, Prof Whitty made very clear that some of the governmentâs restrictive social measures are likely to remain in force until at least the end of 2020 and that it was âwholly unrealisticâ to expect that life would return to normal soon. The Covid-19 virus was not going to disappear, so physical distancing and some lockdown measures were likely to continue for âreally quite a long period of timeâ.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-19-lockdown-take-the-long-view">Continue reading...</a></p>

But we must steel ourselves that a vaccine, as the head of the Wellcome Trust <a href="https://twitter.com/wellcometrust/status/1251810174131736576?s=20" title="">warned</a>, is not a given.</p><p>While no expense should be <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-uk-vaccine-to-be-trialled-on-patients-from-thursday-says-matt-hancock-11976681" title="">spared</a> to find a vaccine, the UK government must also display the wherewithal to design an administrative system to support and enable the public to live with this threat. That means getting the basics right. So far the signs have not been good.

Price is not the only factor</p><p>One of the many effects of the coronavirus in the UK has been to dramatically raise awareness of our food system â that is, the set of arrangements that determines how we shop and eat. Compared with education, health or housing, food is rarely thought of as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis" title="">an area of public policy</a> in which everyone has an interest.

Itâs impossible to summarize what exactly Isaiah Simmons is and what he could be in the NFL. His main selling point is that he doesnât really have a position, as he skips between linebacker, safety, pash-rusher and cornerback. Maybe that will frustrate some teams, itâs nice to know exactly what youâre getting in and whether or not he will fit your needs, but in the modern NFL, thereâs something to be said about a player you can shift from position-to-position based on the situation.

Now, aside from the dates (23-25 April), everything about the three-day spectacle has changed.

<p><span class="badge badge-primary">GUARDIAN</span>&nbsp;<span class="ago">1 week ago</span>
<p class="card-text"><p>A superb new ESPN documentary series reminds us that everything in the NBA legendâs playing career was bent towards a single goal: winning</p><p>Have we never seen Michael Jordan like this before, or is it simply that we forgot? Anyone who lived through the Chicago Bullsâ domination of the NBA during the 1990s â even, like me, as a kid â can probably still recall the broad outlines of Jordanâs talent, the qualities that made him such an exceptional athlete: the elasticity; the hang time; the spectacular dunks, ludicrous switch-hands layups, and clutch buzzer-beaters; the raw power. Jordan reigned at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man">âthe end of historyâ</a>, in that curious decade between the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11, and for all his ability with a ball in his hand heâs always seemed a little remote, a little above it all. He was the perfect athlete, in a sense, for the decade that fancied itself post-political. In an era that thought it had figured it all out, Jordan was the player who actually had.</p><p>And yet. As The Last Dance, the 10-part documentary whose first episodes <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29044827/an-all-access-michael-jordan-documentary-how-last-dance-was-made-possible">premiere on ESPN in the US on Sunday</a> (with the worldwide releases for each on Netflix the following day), shows, he was so much more. Yes, Jordan was gloriously, unironically macho. Yes, his body worked like a Swiss army knife, limbs cutting through the air in all directions at one moment then snapping back into a streamlined cylinder the next. Yes, he was capable of outrageous things on the court. But he was also a bully, a wrecking ball, the owner of a volcanic will to win, a man of almost unbearable intensity. However much joy Jordan gave to millions throughout his career, and will surely give to millions more with the release of this banquet of a documentary, itâs hard to escape the feeling that being him â occupying that body, harnessing that talent, channelling that unrelenting drive to be the best â must have been incredibly hard. The Last Dance is nominally about Jordanâs last season with the Bulls, but flashbacks give us the full, luxurious history of His Airness, and what weâre really offered by the end of it all is a study in sympathy. The man who emerges from these 10 hours of pure 90s nostalgia is heroic, preposterous, demanding, difficult, and sometimes outright tyrannical - and somehow only even more appealing for all his flaws. He cared about one thing, and one thing only: winning. Once you understand the singularity of Jordanâs focus, everything else about him makes sense.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/michael-jordan-documentary-espn-the-last-dance-nba">Continue reading...</a></p>

This is important, because the person who goes first begins the game in control, meaning they call a specific basket to make (the more heavily detailed the better). If they make it, the other player has to duplicate it or receive THEIR SCARLET LETTER (starting with H-, with the next being O-, and the one after that R- and so forth.). If the player in control misses the shot they just called, they donât get a letter BUT The other player is now in charge and can start bossing them around. As soon as a player gets their fifth letter, thus spelling out H-O-R-S-E, they are eliminated. </p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-04-17T00:21:32.886Z">1.21am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p><strong>Preamble</strong></p><p>Well, letâs give ESPN another shot at this, shall we?

<p><span class="badge badge-primary">GUARDIAN</span>&nbsp;<span class="ago">1 month ago</span>
<p class="card-text"><p>Just over 100 years ago, the world was in the midst of a pandemic. And just like now it caused havoc in the world of sports</p><p>The disease known as the âSpanish fluâ was first reported in North America in January 1918 in Kansas. By the time owners and organizers began to prepare for the leagueâs second season, the flu was becoming a specter. Due to the virus, only three delegates were able to attend an October 1918 meeting that was required to transfer team ownership and settle on the final number of teams in the league. That same month, Hamby Shore, a star player for the Ottawa Senators, died from the Spanish flu. The rest of the fall would see deaths across sports in North America: a famous curler in Manitoba, an American League umpire in Boston, the president of the Alberta branch of the AAU, the secretary of the Montreal City Amateur Hockey League and the Eastern Hockey Association.</p><p>News about the league planning for its season was printed next to columns advising citizens to wash their hands, keep healthy diets and find cures for the flu in nature. âEvidence seems to prove that this is a germ disease, spread principally by human contact, chiefly through coughing, sneezing or spitting,â the Leader-Telegram in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, wrote. âSo avoid persons having colds â which means avoiding crowds â common drinking cups, roller towels, etc.â Bowling alleys, the sites of competitive tournaments, were mandated to close. âI understand that preparations are being made for different rugby and other games this week,â Toronto health officer Dr Charles Hastings said. âThese games must be discontinued. They only jeopardize peopleâs lives.

<p class="card-text"><p>Abrams could use her office to be the driving force behind a nationwide fight against voter suppression</p><p>Democratic debates in times of coronavirus make for even less interesting television than during normal times, whatever that means in the Trump era. In Sunday nightâs debate, Bernie Sanders had a double task. For the believers, to make a last pitch that he is the better candidate (which, in terms of the presidency, he clearly is). For the realists, his task was to push the inevitable nominee, Joe Biden, more to the left. He probably achieved neither, as Biden stole the show, by announcing (cleverly) that he will pick a female vice-presidential candidate, a progressive weak point of Sanders (who has remained unclear on this point).</p><p>Of course, the announcement should come as little surprise, given how important women have been in the anti-Trump mobilization â the 2017 Womenâs March was likely the largest single-day demonstration in US history, while black and suburban women were crucial to the âblue waveâ that brought the Democratic party the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. And there has been broad and loud disappointment that the most diverse candidate field in any US primary has ended up with just two old white men standing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/vice-president-stacey-abrams-real-democracy-first-time-biden-sanders">Continue reading...</a></p>

<p class="card-text"><p>The league will have 30 teams by 2022, and that figure may rise even higher. But there are fears that expansion has come at the cost of quality</p><p>The number â25â has formed a central pillar of Major League Soccerâs promotional push ahead of the new season as the competition celebrates a quarter century of existence. Twenty-six also holds some significance, with the introduction of Inter Miami and Nashville further expanding MLS to 26 teams. By next year the league will count 28 franchises among its ranks. There will be 30 by 2022.</p><p>This represents a 300% growth since 1996, when the leagueâs 10 founding teams contested the inaugural MLS season. Of course, there are many yardsticks with which to measure the maturation of the league over the past 25 years, but this rapid expansion must be considered a sign of MLSâs overall success.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/18/is-promotion-and-relegation-any-closer-in-us-soccer">Is promotion and relegation any closer in US soccer?</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/mls-expansion-teams-soccer">Continue reading...</a></p>
