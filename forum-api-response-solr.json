      "body":"<P>12-3-2019<\/P>\n<P>I HAVE A 2020 PILOT ELITE IN THE SHOP WITH SIMILAR CONCERN. SHUT DOWN REASONS ARE FOR THE REAR INFORTAINMENT UNIT AND OPTICAL DISC. SPOKE WITH TECHLINE, WAS INFORMED THEY HAVE BOUGHT BACK 3 VEHICLES WITH THE SPEAKERS&nbsp;CRACKLING AND INFOTAINMENT/RES SHUTTING DOWN&nbsp;CONCERN.<\/P>\n<P>WITH HONDA ENGINEERS AND ENGINEERS FROM THE OHIO FACTORY PRESENT, UPON INSPECTION AND TEAR DOWN OF VEHICLES THEY FOUND THAT THE DASH HARNESS WAS IMPROPERLY ROUTED FROM FACTORY. WHEN TIGHTENING DOWN THE TWO BRACKET BOLTS FOR THE BLU RAY PLAYER, IT CAUSES STRESS/TENSION ON THE HARNESS. SPECIFICALLY THE FAKRA CONNECTORS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE BLU RAY PLAYER. IT ISN'T BREAKING THEM OR COMPLETELY DISCONNECTING THEM, BUT PUTTING ENOUGH TENSION ON THEM THAT IN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS WILL CAUSE INTERMITTENT CONNECTION ISSUES.<\/P>\n<P>WAS INFORMED THAT WHEN BLU-RAY PLAYER IS REMOVED CONNECTORS LOOK OK, BUT ONCE RE-INSTALLED THATS WHEN THE CONNECTION IS COMPROMISED.<\/P>\n<P>I WAS TOLD&nbsp;THAT YES, REPLACING THE DASH HARNESS CAN FIX THE ISSUE BUT THEY BELIEVE IT'S MORE IN THE ROUTING OF THE DASH HARNESS THAN IT IS THE PART ITSELF. THE HARNESSES THEY HAVE&nbsp;RECEIVED BACK WERE CHECKED AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM.<\/P>\n<P>SO AT THIS TIME, I WILL BE RE-ROUTING THE BLU-RAY PORTION OF THE DASH HARNESS PER TECHLINE.<\/P>\n<P>THE BLU-RAY PORTION OF THE HARNESS ON THE VEHICLE I AM WORKING ON, GOES OVER A CROSS BAR SECTION OF THE DASH BRACKET. WAS INFORMED TO RE-ROUTE IT <STRONG>UNDER<\/STRONG> THE CROSS BAR SECTION SO THAT WHEN BLU RAY PLAYER BRACKET IS RE-INSTALLED, IT WON'T/SHOULDN'T PUT STRESS ON THE FAKRA CONNECTORS. ALSO TOLD TO CHECK HARNESS ROUTING OF RES CONTROL UNIT AND RELIEVE ANY STRESS POINTS FOUND.<\/P>\n<P>I WILL UPLOAD PICTURES AS SOON AS I CAN. WILL TEST DRIVE AFTER RE-ROUTING OF HARNESS AND UPDATE.<\/P>\n<P>&nbsp;<\/P>\n<P><EM><STRONG>**THIS MAY ONLY APPLY TO CERTAIN CONCERNS AND CONDITIONS. I HAVE READ SIMILAR FORUM POSTS ABOUT REPLACING FLOOR HARNESSES AND OTHER COMPONENTS. DON'T WANT TO&nbsp;SAY THIS WILL FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS. COULD ONLY PERTAIN TO CONDITIONS WITH RES AND BLU-RAY SHUT DOWN REASONS**<\/STRONG><\/EM><\/P>",
